<p>Horizons is a low cost gaming computer built from free and used parts to try and offer console level gaming performance for under $250</p>

<p><b>A word on the prices...</b></p>
<p>I took the time to find the lowest cost parts. I search online bought from friends and asked around. I don’t consider the prices I paid to be <b>extremely</b> below average but I did get a deal on most of the parts.</p>
<p>I think anyone who spends the time to look for parts like I did can find similar parts at similar prices.<p>
<p>A <b>TOP TIP®</b>™ for finding a cheap case like I did is to look around at second hand shop (e.g Goodwill) or garage sales for old computers that support ATX. emachines are the best for support and that's what I used, it came from a still working $5 Pentium D system that I used for later. My system even came with a PSU that was easy to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Pin-Molex-Female-Adapter-Length/dp/B007NMSUUA">adapt </a> to support a video card. I still felt it would be a better idea to upgrade it.</p>

<h1>Strength and weakness</h1>
<hr>
<p>This system has a lot of things going for it but a few down sides.</p>
<p> ‣ Storage: 120GB is most likely not going to cut it for most people. Swap out the SSD for a bigger hard drive if you value space over speed
<p> ‣ Overclocking: The reason I went with the pentium is because of how well it OC’s Overclocking is a must with this build to get every bit of performance. If you don’t feel comfortable OC’ing don't go the pentium road.
<p> ‣ No Hyper threading: <a href="https://youtu.be/JxUPJdcChzE?t=3m10s">Some games</a> and programs use HT for better performance. The games I play don’t so I chose the cheaper and faster pentium instead of a i3. Do your research to find if it’s going to be a disadvantage for you.
<p> ‣ EOL parts: EOL or end of life means that there is no upgrade potential for this system. Any new parts (other than video cards) will not work in this system. You can only upgrade to old parts that are faster.</p>

<h1>The Build</h1>
<img src="inside.jpg" alt="PCview" style="width:416px;height:259px;">
<hr>
<p> Just like most PCs this system was easy to build
<h1>Peformance</h1>
<hr>
<p> So how well does it run games?
<p> I'm going to include some benchmakrs for both 3.8GHZ because thats the max OC I could get on the stock cooler and 4.5Ghz what I got on my GAMMAXX 300.
<p> Numbers are got from FRAPS, NZXT Cam and my eyes.
