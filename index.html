<p>A word on the prices...</p>
<p>I took the time to find the lowest cost parts. I search online bought from friends and asked around. I don’t consider the prices I paid to be <b>extremely<b> below average but I did get a deal on most of the parts.</p>
<p>I think anyone who spends the time to look for parts like I did can find them at the price I paid or close to it.<p>
<p>A <b>TOP TIP®<b>™ for find cheap cases like I did is, look around at second hand shops (e.g Good-Will) and garage sales. My case came from a computer I bought for $5 at a garage sale. I took out the still working.<p>
